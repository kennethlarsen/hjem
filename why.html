    <h1>Why have I built my website like this?</h1>
    <p>Recently, I completely lost hope for the internet and more specifically for web developement. Everything is owned
      by the same few tech giants and developers are rushing to create things in the same way that the giants create it.
      With the hope that they might work for the giants one day.</p>
    <p>I want to recreate the excitement I had when making websites for the first time. I never cared about build
      systems, deployments,
      design libraries, npm or anything like that. I want to build spaces for exploration.</p>
    <p>That's why I'm building my site like this. There will be hidden gems and they will need some exploration. But
      that
      is part of what is great about the web.</p>

    <p>You see an old man in a chair. He says:</p>
    <pre>
      The car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel
      And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides
      And a dark wind blows
      The government is corrupt
      And we're on so many drugs
      With the radio on and the curtains drawn
      We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine
      And the machine is bleeding to death
      The sun has fallen down
      And the billboards are all leering
      And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles
      It went like this:
      The buildings tumbled in on themselves
      Mothers clutching babies picked through the rubble
      And pulled out their hair
      The skyline was beautiful on fire
      All twisted metal stretching upwards
      Everything washed in a thin orange haze
      I said: "kiss me, you're beautiful -
      These are truly the last days"
      You grabbed my hand and we fell into it
      Like a daydream or a fever
      We woke up one morning and fell a little further down -
      For sure it's the valley of death
      I open up my wallet
      And it's full of blood</pre>

    <h1>Hello, I'm Kenneth.</h1>

    <p>I am a web developer who turned manager. Currently, I work as an engineering manager at Clark in Frankfurt am
      Main, Germany. I also spend quite some time on open source and I'm currently a core team member of the <a
        href="https://emberjs.com/teams" target="_blank">Ember Learning team.</a></p>

    <p>Recently, I've been concerned with spending time at the computer. My back is hurting and honestly, the things I
      see on the internet doesn't inspire me in the same way anymore. So I try to spend more time outside looking at
      birds and trees.</p>

    <p>Here are some things you can explore on my personal website:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="links.html">My favorite links</a>
      </li>
      <li><a href="me.html">What I am currently up to</a></li>
      <li><a href="world/index.html">Visit my virtual world</a></li>
      <li><a href="garden/index.html">My virtual garden</a></li>
      <li><a href="art/index.html">A collection of auto-generated art</a></li>
      <li><a href="guestbook.html"><b>Leave a message in my guestbook!</b></a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can contact me via email: hello at kennethlarsen dot org.</p>

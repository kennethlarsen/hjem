    <h1>Hello, I'm Kenneth.</h1>

    <p>I am a web developer who turned manager. Currently, I work as an engineering manager at Clark in Frankfurt am
      Main, Germany. I also spend quite some time on open source and is currently a core team member of the <a
        href="https://emberjs.com/teams" target="_blank">Ember Learning team.</a></p>

    <p>Recently, I've been concerned with spending time at the computer. My back is hurting and honestly, the things I
      see on the internet doesn't inspire me in the same way anymore. So I try to spend more time outside looking at
      birds and trees.</p>

    <p>You can contact me via email: hello at kennethlarsen dot org.</p>

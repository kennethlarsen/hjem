    <p>Hello, my name is Kenneth Larsen. I work as an engineering manager at Clark and I am a member of the Ember Learning Core Team.</p>

    <p>I co-host <a href="https://ember.report" target="_blank">The Ember Report</a> and every week I <a href="https://world.hey.com/kennethlarsen">write about product development.</a></p>

    <p>This page is intentionally left <i>non-fancy</i>. I believe in a simple and accessible web.</p>

    <p>If you want to get in touch with me, I prefer email above anything else: kennethlarsen at hey dot com.</p>
